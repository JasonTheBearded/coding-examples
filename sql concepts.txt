Primary Key:
  constraint to uniquely identify each record in a table
  must contain unique records and not be null
  tables can only have one
  
Foreign Key:
  used to link two tables together
  field in one table that refers to a primary key in another table
  parent child relationship

DIST Styles
  - AUTO
    assigns an optimal style based on the size of the table data
  - EVEN
    leader node distributes rows across the slices in a round-robin fashion, like a dealer 
    handing out cards to each person in a table
  - KEY
    distributes according to values in one column. leader node places matching values on the same node.
    if distributed on joining keys, leader node collocates rows on the slices so that matching values on common columns are
    physically stored together
  - ALL
    copy of the entire table is distributed on every node

Difference between clustered and non-clustered index:

 - Clustered Index
  - Cluster index is a type of index which sorts the data rows in the table on their key values. In the Database, there is only one         clustered index per table.

    A clustered index defines the order in which data is stored in the table which can be sorted in only one way. So, there can be an  
    only a single clustered index for every table. In an RDBMS, usually, the primary key allows you to create a clustered index based 
    on that specific column.
 
 - Non-Clustered Index
  - A Non-clustered index stores the data at one location and indices at another location. The index contains pointers to the 
    location of that data. A single table can have many non-clustered indexes as an index in the non-clustered index is stored in  
    different places.

    For example, a book can have more than one index, one at the beginning which displays the contents of a book unit wise while the 
    second index shows the index of terms in alphabetical order.

    A non-clustering index is defined in the non-ordering field of the table. This type of indexing method helps you to improve the 
    performance of queries that use keys which are not assigned as a primary key. A non-clustered index allows you to add a unique 
    key for a table.

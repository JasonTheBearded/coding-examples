DIST Styles
  - AUTO
    assigns an optimal style based on the size of the table data
  - EVEN
    leader node distributes rows across the slices in a round-robin fashion, like a dealer 
    handing out cards to each person in a table
  - KEY
    distributes according to values in one column. leader node places matching values on the same node.
    if distributed on joining keys, leader node collocates rows on the slices so that matching values on common columns are
    physically stored together
  - ALL
    copy of the entire table is distributed on every node
